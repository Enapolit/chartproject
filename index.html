	   <p>Hate crime reports have risen 106% citywide this year, according to NYPD data shared by the Hate Crime Review Panel at a press conference in Brooklyn Wednesday evening.</p> 
	<p>NYPD reports of anti-Asian, Jewish and LGBTQ crimes rose significantly, with anti-Asian attacks surging 361% from last year, reviewers revealed.</p>
	   <p>The NYPD said it has worked in tandem with the panel to improve its hate crime responses, but panel members implored the NYPD to give more weight to victims’ trauma when determining whether hate crimes were biased or unbiased. They also demanded that Gov. Hochul update New York’s hate crime statutes so officials can combat crimes more effectively.</p>
<p>Devorah Halberstam, the all-civilian panel’s Jewish representative, said the group has evaluated more than 100 cases since it first convened in April. </p>  
<p>“We have eight borough commands…six of them have brought major crime indicators, most notably, shootings, back down to pre-pandemic levels. In Brooklyn, especially, there’s a 20% reduction [in shootings].”</p>  
	   <p>Still, the number of shootings outside of Brooklyn increased significantly from 2020 to 2021 in four out of the NYPD’s eight borough commands, including Queens South (4.8%), Manhattan South (18.5%), Manhattan North (27%) and the Bronx (31.4%).</p>

<p>Gun violence rates for the entire city, however, are still down from last spring, when shootings were up 166% from the previous year.</p>
<p>The city’s effort to combat shootings and other violent crimes is a point of pride for DeBlasio, who reminded his audience that other U.S. cities remain in dire straits.</p> 
<p>“Strikingly important in [October], compared to a year ago, murder is down almost 10%," said de Blasio. “Contrast that to what we’re seeing nationwide...murder is going up substantiatially nationwide. Major cities across the USA — Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia — are struggling.”</p> 
<p>De Blasio attributed declining murder rates to NYPD gun arrests. In October, 400 guns were removed from the streets, bringing the total number of gun seizures to 4,000 for the year to date. 
<p>There are, however, two city regions where shooters still strike often.  
<p>“We have to keep our attention on The Bronx,” said de Blasio. “Lots of resources are being poured into addressing [gun violence] there [and in] Manhattan North.”</p>  
<p>The Bronx experienced a 75% increase in gun violence from pre-pandemic levels, compared to a 23% increase in gun-related incidents citywide. As a result, it has become the focal point of officers' efforts to tackle the city’s illegal firearm epidemic, Harrison says.</p>  
<p>“The Bronx is still struggling. It’s the only borough with over 1000 gun arrests year to date," said Harrison. “That's an increase of 22% from last year.” 
<p>Whether those numbers improve, de Blasio says, is a matter of communities’ willingness to work in tandem with the NYPD.</p>  
<p>“We’ve got to get the public more involved,” said de Blasio. “Safety derives not just from the presence of trained police officers, but from the community. We need people to join Build a Block meetings and get involved.”</p>
