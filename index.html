    <h1>Gun Violence Hits New Highs in Half of NYPD Borough Commands </h1>

	   <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio praised “significant” reductions in citywide crime during a public address at City Hall Wednesday morning.</p> 
	<p>De Blasio announced murders and shootings are down in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Manhattan, but not in the Bronx, following a year-long, pandemic-driven spike in violent crime citywide. The mayor was joined by NYPD Department Chief Rodney Harrison, who highlighted the importance of “precision policing” strategies to continue tackling violent crimes. Harrison also urged New Yorkers to attend neighborhood policing events to help officers combat crimes in the Bronx, where the number of shootings remains stubbornly high.</p>  
<p>De Blasio says crime in 75% of NYPD borough commands, or policing regions, is “at or near” pre-pandemic levels.</p>  
<p>“We have eight borough commands…six of them have brought major crime indicators, most notably, shootings, back down to pre-pandemic levels. In Brooklyn, especially, there’s a 20% reduction [in shootings].”</p>

<p>Progress in Brooklyn, and elsewhere, shows New York is reversing course since last spring when shootings were up 166% from the previous year.</p> 
<p>The city’s crime reversal is a point of pride for DeBlasio, who reminded his audience that other U.S. cities remain in dire straits.</p> 
<p>Nationwide, murders are up 16%, de Blasio said — the largest increase in U.S. crime since the 1960s.</p>  
<p>“Strikingly important in [October], compared to a year ago, murder is down almost 10%," said de Blasio. “Contrast that to what we’re seeing nationwide...murder is going up substantiatially nationwide. Major cities across the USA — Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia — are struggling.”</p> 
<p>De Blasio attributed declining murder rates to NYPD gun arrests. In October, 400 guns were taken off the streets by the NYPD, bringing the total number of gun seizures to 4,000 for the year to date. 
<p>There are, however, two city regions where gun violence is still concerning. 
<p>“We have to keep our attention on The Bronx,” said de Blasio. “Lots of resources are being poured into addressing [gun violence] there [and in] Manhattan North as well. Those two continue to be a challenge.”</p>  
<p>The Bronx, which experienced a 75% increase in gun violence from pre-pandemic levels this year, compared to a 23% increase in gun-related incidents across the city’s other boroughs, remains a focal point of officers' efforts to tackle the city’s illegal firearm epidemic, Harrison says.</p>  
<p>“The Bronx is still struggling. It’s the only borough with over 1000 gun arrests year to date, '' said Harrison. “That's an increase of 22% from last year.” 
<p>Harrison says the NYPD’s work in the Bronx might be able to bring down gun violence if community members and police work together to identify violent crime risks to local communities.</p>  
<p>“Neighborhood policing is back in the Bronx and everywhere,” said Harrison. “We’ve had 274 build the block meetings within the past month identifying issues with the communities and working together to solve them.”</p>
