    <h1>Anti-Asian Hate Crimes on the Rise in New York City</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Anti-asian hate crimes drives doubling in hate crime complaints from last year</p>

	   <p>Anti-asian hate crimes have surged 361% from last year, according to NYPD data shared at a press conference for the NYPD Hate Crimes panel last week. 
</p> 
	<p>The rise in anti-Asian crime has driven a 106% increase in hate crimes across all bias categories citywide.  
</p>
	   <p>TThe NYPD’s Hate Crimes Panel, which is composed of representatives from the Black, Muslim, Asian and Jewish communties, says crime against Asian and Asian-American communities is up due to the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China. They also say the NYPD’s method of determining whether or not a hate crime is, in fact, a hate crime has allowed some anti-Asian aggressions to slide under the radar. 
</p>
<p>Anti-Asian crime jumped from 28 incidents in 2020 to 129 incidents in 2021. Anti-LGBT cases, they noted, have also surged 193%, while anti-Semitic acts are up from 121 incidents in 2020 to 183 in 2021.</p>  
<p>Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition aimed at addressing anti-Asian discrimination, says the disproportionate uptick in anti-Asian crime likely represents just some of the coronavirus-related racial attacks that have affected the Asian-American community. 
</p>  
	   <p>“There has been a huge uptick in what police are calling ‘anti-covid’ attacks, but the data clearly shows that it’s Asian Americans who are the victims of these crimes,” said Kulkarni. “Many times of these attacks are occuring in Asian-majority neighborhoods. Hate incidents that we have been tracking since March 2020 are not going away,” 
</p>
	   <p> The NYPD recorded just four anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020, while it recorded 25 “anti-COVID” crimes within the same year, a NYPD official told Gothamist. 
 </p>
	   <p>While anti-Asian crimes aren’t always recorded as anti-Asian crimes, it is clear that hate crime incidents are heavily concentrated in heavily-Asian neighborhoods. </p>
	   <p>Half of the top six police precinct areas with the most hate crimes per capita in 2021 were regions with Asian-majority populations.</p>

<p>Gun violence rates for the entire city, however, are still down from last spring, when shootings were up 166% from the previous year.</p>
<p>The city’s effort to combat shootings and other violent crimes is a point of pride for DeBlasio, who reminded his audience that other U.S. cities remain in dire straits.</p> 
<p>“Strikingly important in [October], compared to a year ago, murder is down almost 10%," said de Blasio. “Contrast that to what we’re seeing nationwide...murder is going up substantiatially nationwide. Major cities across the USA — Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Philadelphia — are struggling.”</p> 
<p>De Blasio attributed declining murder rates to NYPD gun arrests. In October, 400 guns were removed from the streets, bringing the total number of gun seizures to 4,000 for the year to date. 
<p>There are, however, two city regions where shooters still strike often.  
<p>“We have to keep our attention on The Bronx,” said de Blasio. “Lots of resources are being poured into addressing [gun violence] there [and in] Manhattan North.”</p>  
<p>The Bronx experienced a 75% increase in gun violence from pre-pandemic levels, compared to a 23% increase in gun-related incidents citywide. As a result, it has become the focal point of officers' efforts to tackle the city’s illegal firearm epidemic, Harrison says.</p>  
<p>“The Bronx is still struggling. It’s the only borough with over 1000 gun arrests year to date," said Harrison. “That's an increase of 22% from last year.” 
<p>Whether those numbers improve, de Blasio says, is a matter of communities’ willingness to work in tandem with the NYPD.</p>  
<p>“We’ve got to get the public more involved,” said de Blasio. “Safety derives not just from the presence of trained police officers, but from the community. We need people to join Build a Block meetings and get involved.”</p>
