    <h1>Anti-Asian Hate Crimes on the Rise in New York City</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>Anti-asian hate crimes drives doubling in hate crime complaints from last year</p>
	   <p>By Elizabeth Napolitano</p>
	   
	   <p>Anti-asian hate crimes have surged 361% from last year, according to NYPD data shared at a press conference for the NYPD Hate Crimes panel last week. 
</p> 
	<p>The rise in anti-Asian crime has driven a 106% increase in hate crimes across all bias categories citywide.  
</p>
	   <p>TThe NYPD’s Hate Crimes Panel, which is composed of representatives from the Black, Muslim, Asian and Jewish communties, says crime against Asian and Asian-American communities is up due to the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in Wuhan, China. They also say the NYPD’s method of determining whether or not a hate crime is, in fact, a hate crime has allowed some anti-Asian aggressions to slide under the radar. 
</p>
<p>Anti-Asian crime jumped from 28 incidents in 2020 to 129 incidents in 2021. Anti-LGBT cases, they noted, have also surged 193%, while anti-Semitic acts are up from 121 incidents in 2020 to 183 in 2021.</p>  
<p>Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition aimed at addressing anti-Asian discrimination, says the disproportionate uptick in anti-Asian crime likely represents just some of the coronavirus-related racial attacks that have affected the Asian-American community. 
</p>  
	   <p>“There has been a huge uptick in what police are calling ‘anti-covid’ attacks, but the data clearly shows that it’s Asian Americans who are the victims of these crimes,” said Kulkarni. “Many times of these attacks are occuring in Asian-majority neighborhoods. Hate incidents that we have been tracking since March 2020 are not going away,” 
</p>
	   <p> The NYPD recorded just four anti-Asian hate crimes in 2020, while it recorded 25 “anti-COVID” crimes within the same year, a NYPD official told Gothamist. 
 </p>
	   <p>While anti-Asian crimes aren’t always recorded as anti-Asian crimes, it is clear that hate crime incidents are heavily concentrated in heavily-Asian neighborhoods. </p>
	   <p>Half of the top six police precinct areas with the most hate crimes per capita in 2021 were regions with Asian-majority populations.</p>
